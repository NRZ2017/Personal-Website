      <p id="AboutDesc">Hi! My name is Ruizhe Zhao, but I go by Nick. I am a sophomore studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Southern California. Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by the computer and its power. The idea of using code to talk to computers is really interesting to me, and as such I want to pursue a career in Computer Science. Of course, although I spend a lot of time researching and developing my skills in this area, it doesn’t mean this is all I do in my life. Outside of working on projects and writing code, I like to work out, play video games, and hang out with friends and family, as well as practice my butterfly knife skills (which if you ask nicely I might show you a trick or two). <br><br>
If asked what my philosophy in life is, I would definitely say balance. I believe that a person needs to be rounded, not just excel at one particular field. When people first meet me, they expected me to become a studious person who only spends hours of his day studying and researching. However, that is not the case. I am not defined by what other people say I am, and because I believe in balance and well-roundedness in everything, I try to be different. I enjoy working out and hanging out with friends. I am more of a social butterfly than someone who’s more quiet. Those are the expectations that others had on me, but I do not conform to them. I am Nick Zhao, and no one else gets to define who I am but me.
